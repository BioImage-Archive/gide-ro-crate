      "description": "The abscission of floral organs and emergence of lateral roots in Arabidopsis is regulated by the peptide ligand INFLORESCENCE DEFICIENT IN ABSCISSION (IDA) and the receptor protein kinases HAESA (HAE) and HAESA-LIKE 2 (HSL2). During these cell separation processes, the plant induces defense-associated genes to protect against pathogen invasion. However, the molecular coordination between abscission and immunity has not been thoroughly explored. Here we show that IDA induces a release of cytosolic calcium ions (Ca2+) and apoplastic production of reactive oxygen species, which are signatures of early defense responses. In addition, we find that IDA promotes late defense responses by the transcriptional upregulation of genes known to be involved in immunity. When comparing the IDA induced early immune responses to known immune responses, such as those elicited by flagellin22 treatment, we observe both similarities and differences. We propose a molecular mechanism by which IDA promotes signatures of an immune response in cells destined for separation to guard them from pathogen attack.",

      "description": "[Ca2+]cyt in roots were detected using WT plants expressing the cytosolic localized single-fluorophore based Ca2+ sensor, R-GECO1 in Col-0 background (Keinath et al., 2015). Measurements were performed using a confocal laser scanning microscopy Leica TCS SP8 STED 3X using a 20x multi NA 0.75 objective. Images were recorded with a frame rate of 5 seconds at 400 Hz. Seedling mounting was performed as described in (Krebs & Schumacher, 2013). The plant tissues were incubated overnight in half strength MS, 21°C and continuous light conditions before the day of imaging. [Ca2+]cyt in the abscission zone were detected using WT plants expressing R-GECO1 (Keinath et al., 2015). Abscission zones of position 7 were used. Mounting of the abscission zones were performed using the same device as for seedlings (Krebs & Schumacher, 2013). The abscission zones were incubated in half strength MS medium for 1 h before imaging. Measurements were performed with a Zeiss LSM880 Airyscan using a Plan-Apochromat 10× air NA 0.30 objective. Images were recorded with a frame rate of 10 seconds. R-GECO1 was excited with a white light laser at 561 nm and its emission was detected at 590 nm to 670 nm using a HyD detector. Laser power and gain settings were chosen for each experiment to maintain comparable intensity values. For mIDA and flg22 two-fold concentrations were prepared in half strength MS. mIDA or flg22 were added in a 1:1 volume ratio to the imaging chamber (final concentration 1 µM). ATP was prepared in a 100-fold concentration in half strength MS and added as a last treatment in a 1:100 volume ratio (final concentration 1 mM) to the imaging chamber as a positive control for activity of the R-GECO1 sensor (Movie 3). Image processing was performed in FIJI. These steps are: background subtraction, gaussian blur, MultiStackReg v1.45 (http://bradbusse.net/sciencedownloads.html), 32-bit conversion, threshold. Royal was used as a look up table. Fluorescence intensities of indicated ROIs were obtained from the 32-bit images (Krebs & Schumacher, 2013). Normalization was done using the following formula ΔF/F = (F-F0)/F0 where F0 represents the mean of at least 1 min measurement without any treatment. R-GECO1 measurements were performed at the Center for Advanced imaging (CAi) at HHU and at NorMIC Imaging platform at the University of Oslo.",
