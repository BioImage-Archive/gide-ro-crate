      "description": "Confocal microscopy and image processing\n\n\tAll confocal microscopy was carried out on an LSM 880 Airyscan. For general image acquisition, image size was set to 4096 x 4096 pixels, with a per-pixel scaling of 0.10 μm x 0.10 μm on a Plan-Apochromat 20x/0.8 M27 objective at 1X zoom. Unidirectional scan speed was set to provide a 0.68 μs pixel-dwell, and bit-depth and averaging were set to 16. Per fluorophore, the following emission wavelength cutoffs were used: NucBlue (411-450 nm), sfGFP (491-534 nm), mCherry (580-632 nm), and Alexa iFluor 647 phalloidin (640-701 nm). Pinholes were set to 1 Airy Unit (AU). To generate 3D models, a 40X variant of this method with z-stacks (10 μm of tissue; 0.33 μm slice spacing) and tiling was used. In replicating GAP studies, a Zeiss Axio Observer was also used.\n\n\tImage processing was performed in Zen Blue and Zen Black, with deconvolution of sfGFP and mCherry performed in ImageJ. Diffraction PSF 3D was used to generate PSFs, and Deconvolution Lab (Sage et al., 2017) was used to perform Fast Iterative Shrinkage Thresholding (5 iterations, γ = 1, λ = 0.1, wavelets = spline 3, and scale = 3). A bandpass Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was used for size-based exclusion of lumen background. In Zen Blue, the following sequential steps and corresponding thresholds were used: Background Subtraction (150), Single Pixel Filter (1.5), Gauss (1.15), and Unsharp Mask (0.5). After Min/Max autoscaling of the histograms, this file was saved as a TIFF to have HDR applied in sampling mode with an intensity of 2 in Zen Black.\n\n\tFor RNAScope-based assays, an Airyscan (CO) protocol was developed. Image size was set to 1024 x 1024 pixels, with a per-pixel scaling of 0.07 μm x 0.07 μm on a Plan-Apochromat 63X/1.4 Oil DIC M27 objective at 2X zoom, with 0.02 μm x 0.02 μm per-pixel scaling and 8X zoom used for inset magnifications. Pixel dwell was set to 2.05 μs and averaging was set to 8 for acquisition of 16-bit images. Per laser line, the following pinholes were used: 405 nm (2.94 AU), 514 nm (2.21 AU), 543 nm (1 AU), and 633 nm (1 AU). Images were processed with four-component linear unmixing and bandpass FFT prior to saving as TIFF for HDR application.\n\n        For histopathological image generation and analysis (AB/PAS), Hamamatsu Photonics NDP.scan was employed for complete slide scanning. For counting goblet cells and determining crypt lengths, resulting images were analyzed with Hamamatsu Photonics NDP-view2.\n",
