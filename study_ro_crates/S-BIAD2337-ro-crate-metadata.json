      "description": "Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1) activity is thought to be spatiotemporally defined by hundreds of different regulatory subunits, but their mechanisms of action are largely unknown. The Ankyrin repeat, SH3-domain, and Proline-rich region containing Proteins (ASPPs) bind and localize PP1 to cell-cell junctions. Here, we show ASPPs bind superstoichiometric amounts of PP1. Missense mutations in the ankyrin repeats of ASPPs, that were previously isolated from a forward genetic screen in Caenorhabditis elegans, reduce the stoichiometry of PP1 binding. Forcing PP1 oligomerization restores mutant ASPP function in vivo. We propose that ASPPs multimerize PP1 to establish a concentrated hub of phosphatase activity at cell-cell junctions.",

      "description": "Samples were imaged on a custom-built TIRF microscope (as described above) with the addition of a Zero-order quarter-wave plate (WPQ10M-633, ThorLabs) to circularly polarize the 647 nm laser (Coherent OBIS). Samples were imaged continuously at 20 frames/sec for ~50 sec while simultaneously exciting with 488 nm (~4 mW) and 647 nm (~21 mW) lasers for a total of 1000 frames/channel. Laser powers were tuned such that the bleach half-time of our JF646 labeled HaloTag::GSP-2 was ~1/5 of our total imaging time and our APE-1::GFP::3xflag was ~1/10 of our total imaging time. Bleach half-times were calculated using a half-time calculation software at https://github.com/dickinson-lab/SiMPull-Analysis-Software/blob/master/Static_Analysis/Visualization/bleachHalfTime.m [56]. Each single-molecule imaging session began by acquiring a registration image, in which 0.1 μm TetraSpeck fluorescent microsphere beads (T7279, ThermoFisher) were imaged in green and far-red channels, to allow for proper colocalization analysis in subsequent steps.",
