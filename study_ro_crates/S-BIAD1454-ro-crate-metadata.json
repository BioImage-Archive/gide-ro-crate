      "description": "Sample preparation for STED microscopy\nTo prepare genome-edited HK cells expressing endogenously EGFP-tagged Cohesin-STAG1/2 for STED microscopy in early G1 or G1, cells were synchronized in mitosis and subsequently released into mitotic exit, pre-extracted, PFA-fixed and immuno-stained. Cell synchronization was performed by mitotic shake-off as described above. 35 µL of Nocodazole-arrested enriched mitotic cells were added at a density of 1.2x106 cells/ml (for G1) or 2.5x106 cells/ml (for early G1) to pre-washed and poly-L-lysine coated channels of Ibidi µ Slide glass bottom slides (80607, Ibidi) and incubated for 15 minutes at 37°C, 5% CO2 to allow cells to attach. Subsequently, 3 washes with fresh DMEM were performed to wash out Nocodazole, and cells were allowed to exit mitosis for 45 minutes (for early G1 stage) or 4h (for G1 stage) at 37°C, 5% CO2. Pre-extraction was performed by washing cells once in PBS and then adding 0.25% Tergitol in 1X PBS for a total of 1 minute. Cells were then immediately fixed using 2.4% PFA in PBS for 15 minutes, followed by quenching of PFA (15710, EMS) with 100 mM NH4Cl in PBS and washing with PBS. Fixed cells were prepared for immuno-staining by an additional 15-minute permeabilization (standard IF protocol) in PBS with 0.25% Tergitol and subsequent blocking using blocking buffer (2% BSA in 0.05% Tergitol in PBS) for at least 30 minutes at RT. Incubation with the anti-GFP nanobody (FluoTag®-X4 anti-GFP conjugated to Abberior® Star 635P, 1:250 dilution N0304-Ab635P, NanoTag) and rabbit anti-CTCF antibody (Glycine-Elution, 1:3000, Wutz et. al 2020) was performed in blocking buffer at 4°C in a humidified chamber overnight. Secondary hybridization using AF594-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit antibody (1:1000, A11037, Life Technologies) was performed for 1h at RT. Samples were post-fixed for 15 minutes in 2.4% PFA in PBS, with subsequent quenching (100 mM NH4Cl in PBS) and PBS washing. Samples were imaged by STED super-resolution microscopy on the same day. \n\nSTED microscopy\n2D STED imaging was performed on a Leica Stellaris 8 STED Falcon FLIM microscope (Leica Microsystems) controlled by the Leica LAS X software (4.7.0.28176). Samples were imaged at RT using a HC PL APO 86x/1.2 W motCORR STED white water immersion objective. The microscope was equipped with the SuperK FIANIUM FIB-12 white light laser with laser pulse picker (440-790 nm, Leica Microsystems/NKT), 592 nm continuous wave (cw), 660 nm cw and 775 nm pulsed lasers (MPB Communications) and the HyD S, HyD X and HyD R detectors. Diffraction-limited as well as STED imaging of CTCF (AF594) and STAG1/2-EGFP (Abberior Star 635P) was performed with excitation at 590 nm and 645 nm using the white light laser (diffraction-limited/confocal: 3% each, STED: 590 nm: 9%, 645 nm: 6%). Fluorescence was detected with two HyD X detectors using a 601-619 nm and a 655-750 nm detection window, respectively. Imaging was performed in xy line sequential mode. The pinhole size was set to 1 airy unit and the pixel size set to 18.88x18.88 nm in xy, resulting in images capturing a region of 19.31x19.31 µm with 1024x1024 pixels.  STED imaging was performed using a 2D depletion doughnut and 50% power with a 775 nm depletion laser for super-resolved imaging of CTCF-AF594 and at 12% excitation power at 775nm for imaging of STAG1/2-Abberior Star 635P. STED images were acquired using 16 line accumulations with a scan-speed of 200 Hz resulting in a pixel dwell time of 3.85 µs. STED imaging was performed in FLIM mode and the images were post-processed using tau-STED enhancement with background suppression activated and tau-strength set to 0%. Crosstalk between fluorescence channels was quantified with the settings described above and found to be less than 5% (Suppl. Fig. 5C).  \n\n\n\nSTED image analysis\nPre-processing of diffraction-limited and STED images was performed using Fiji using a custom-made script. Nuclear masks were created by segmenting the CTCF-AF594 diffraction-limited image after gaussian-blurring and used to crop out nuclei in all image channels. In addition, STED images were background subtracted using the rolling ball algorithm set to a radius of 50 pixels. \nCo-localization analysis, as well as spot segmentation was performed using custom python scripts. For co-localization analysis, Pearson correlation coefficient of CTCF and STAG1/2 was computed based on cropped nuclei in the respective STED channel. Spot segmentation was performed by first coarsely segmenting spots inside the nuclear mask based on a common threshold (method: Otsu) after applying a mild gaussian blur (sigma = 1). Image noise resulting in excess tiny spots was filtered out through binary mask erosion and filtering, followed by binary dilation of correctly detected spots. Coarsely segmented spots often represent clusters of spot signals and were further segmented using a combination of local peak finding & watershed. The resulting masks for individual spots were used to extract average pixel intensities in the STED and confocal images. Assuming a z-depth of about 500 nm, the number of detected spots per μm3 was compared to protein number estimates derived by FCS-calibrated imaging of early G1 or G1 cells to estimate the overall labelling efficiency. \n",

Microscope calibration by FCS was performed as described by Politi et al. (2018), but using 10 nM Atto488 carboxylic acid (AD 488-21, ATTO-TEC, Kapusta, 2010) in ddH2O instead of AF488 coupled to a H2O-hydrolyzable NHS ester group to estimate the confocal volume in FCS measurements. Ten FCS- measurements of 1 minute each were performed to estimate the effective confocal volume in the well with Atto488 solution. FCS-measurements of 30 seconds were performed in the nucleus and cytoplasm in WT cells not expressing mEGFP to determine background fluorescence and photon counts. Experiment-specific calibration factors were obtained from interphase cells expressing mEGFP by correlating measured fluorescence intensities and absolute mEGFP concentration calculated from 30 seconds FCS-measurements (Politi et al., 2018). Calibrated 4-dimensional confocal time-lapse imaging was performed on cells expressing the mEGFP- tagged protein of interest (POI). DNA was stained using 5-SiR-Hoechst, the cell outline was marked using fluorescently labelled 500 kDa Dextran.",

Release into mitotic exit was triggered by Nocodazole washout using DMEM containing 500 µM IAA. Cells were fixed 80 minutes after release. Live imaging of cells at this point showed that they are on average about 45 minutes past anaphase. After fixation, early G1 and asynchronous interphase cells were permeabilized for 15 minutes using 0.25% TritonX-100 (T8787, Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS and 0.1 µm Tetraspec beads were added to the Ibidi channels (1:100 dilution from stock, T7279, Thermo Fisher) to be used as fiducials for drift correction. After blocking with 2% BSA in 0.05% TritonX-100 at RT for at least 30 minutes, primary labelling of STAG2 was performed overnight at 4°C in a humidified chamber (with rabbit-anti STAG2, Glycine Elution, 1:200, Sumara et al., 2000), followed by hybridization with an AF488-labelled secondary antibody (goat-anti-rabbit AF488, A-11034, Molecular Probes). \n\nNon-denaturing FISH (RASER-FISH)\nNon-denaturing FISH (RASER-FISH) as well as FISH library design and amplification was performed as described previously (Beckwith et al., 2023 Preprint & Beckwith, Brunner et al., in preparation). In brief, cells were incubated with 0.5 ng/µl DAPI in PBS at RT for 15 minutes to sensitize DNA for UV-induced single-strand nicking of the replicated strand containing BrdU/C. Subsequently, the cells were exposed (without Ibidi lid) to 254 nm UV light for 15 min (Stratalinker 2400 fitted with 15W 254 nm bulbs-part no G15T8). The nicked strand of DNA was then digested using Exonuclease (1U/ul, M0206, NEB) in NEB buffer 1 at 37 °C for 15 min in a humidified chamber. Cells were post-fixed using 5 mM Bis(NHS)PEG5 (803537, Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS for 30 minutes at RT to preserve cell fixation during primary FISH library hybridization at 37°C. Hybridization of primary FISH probe libraries targeting 1.2 Mb regions (Chr14 50.92-52.10 Mb, Chr5 149.50-150.70 Mb, Chr2 191.11-192.31 Mb) with 12 kb genomic resolution (one trace-spot = tiled set of ~150 FISH probes with common docking handle) was performed by incubation with hybridization buffer (50% formamide (FA, AM9342, Thermo Fisher), 10% (w/v) dextran sulfate (D8906, Sigma-Aldrich) in 2xSSC (AM9763, Thermo Fisher) containing the FISH probe libraries at a final concentration of 100-200 ng/µL DNA per library for 1-2 nights at 37°C in a humidified chamber. After primary hybridization, channels were rinsed 3 times with 50% FA in 2xSSC, washed again twice with 50% FA in 2xSSC for 5 min at RT and finally washed with 2xSSC containing 0.2% Tween. RNA-DNA hybrids were removed by incubating cells with 0.05 U/µL RNAse H (M0297S, NEB) for 20 min at 37 °C in RNAse H buffer (NEB). To image and segment whole 1.2 Mb tracing loci, secondary FISH probes serving as bridges between all primary probes of a whole 1.2 Mb locus and a common imager strand were applied at a concentration of 100 nm in secondary hybridization buffer (20% Ethylene Carbonate (EC, E26258, Sigma-Aldrich), 2xSSC) for 20 minutes at RT rocking. Secondary probes were then washed with 30% FA in 2XSSC at RT (3 washes, 5 minutes each) and 2 additional washes with 2xSSC. Prior to imaging, DNA was stained with 0.5 ng/µl DAPI in PBS for 5 minutes at RT.\n\nChromatin Tracing using LoopTrace\n3D DNA trace acquisition using a custom-built automated fluidics setup was performed as described in Beckwith et al., 2023 (Preprint) and in https://git.embl.de/grp-ellenberg/tracebot. In brief, 12-mer imager strands with 3’ or 5’-azide functionality (Metabion) complementary to the docking handles employed by the primary FISH probe library or the bridged regional barcode probes added during secondary hybridization, were fluorescently labelled with Cy3B-alkyne (AAT Bioquest) or Atto643-alkyne (Attotec) using click chemistry (ClickTech Oligo Link Kit, Baseclick GmbH) according to the manufacturer’s instructions to enable dual-color tracing. Fluorescently labelled 12-mer imagers were diluted to a final concentration of 20 nM in 5% EC 2X SSC in a 96 well plate and placed on the stage of a custom-built automated fluidics setup based on a GRBL controlled CNC stage (Beckwith et al., 2023). Furthermore, a 3-well deep plate containing washing buffer (10 % FA, 2X SSC) and stripping buffer (30% FA, 2XSSC) covered with parafilm, as well as a 24-well plate containing imaging buffer (0.2X Glucose Oxidase (G7141, Sigma-Aldrich), 1.5 mM TROLOX (238813, Sigma-Aldrich), 10% Glucose, 50 mM Tris, 2X SSC pH 8.0) were placed on the stage of the automated fluidics setup. A syringe needle mounted in place of the CNC drill head was connected to the sample and a CPP1 peristaltic micropump (Jobst Technologies, Freiburg, Germany, flow rate of 1 mL/min at maximal speed) using 1 mm i.d. PEEK and silicone tubing (VWR), allowing to pull liquids out of the well plates and through the sample channel in an automated manner. Imaging was performed on a Nikon TI-E2 microscope equipped with a Lasercombiner, a 100X 1.35 NA silicon oil immersion objective, a CSU-W1 SoRa spinning disk unit and an Orca Fusion CMOS camera in spinning disk mode, operated using NIS Elements 5.2.02 (Nikon) in combination with custom-made Python software for synchronization with automated liquid handling. Prior to sequential imaging, a 3D stack of DAPI-stained nuclei (405 nm excitation), STAG2-EGFP fluorescence (488 nm excitation) and the fiducial beads (561 or 640 excitation) was acquired as a reference stack for cell classification with a pixel size of 130 nm in xy and 300 nm in z at a total size of 149.76x149.76 µm in xy and covering a z range of 14.1 (interphase) - 18.3 µm (early G1). Subsequently, imager strands were sequentially hybridized for ~ 2 minutes at 20 nM concentration in 5% EC 2X SSC, washed for 1 minute with washing buffer, imaged after addition of GLOX-based imaging buffer as a 3D stack, stripped for ~2 minutes using stripping buffer and washed again for 1 minute. 3D stacks acquired during sequential imaging had equal pixel sizes and z-range as before, but were acquired only in the 561 nm or 640 nm channels (100% laser power, 100 msec exposure time, triggered acquisition mode), to image fiducial beads and Cy3B or Atto643-labelled imagers, respectively. \n\n\nAnalysis of LoopTrace data\nProcessing of acquired tracing data was performed as described in Beckwith et al., 2023 (Preprint) with code available under https://git.embl.de/grp-ellenberg/looptrace. In brief, nd2 image files were converted to OME-ZARR format. Images were drift-corrected based on cross-correlation and sub-pixel drift was corrected by fitting the fiducial bead signal to a 3D gaussian function and subsequent correction for calculated sub-pixel drift. Images were deconvolved using the experimental PSF extracted from fiducial beads. Identification of tracing regions was performed based on regional barcodes using an intensity threshold. Detected spot masks were then used to extract regions of interest for 3D-superlocalisation of individual trace-spots by fitting with a 3D gaussian. Finally, extracted traces were corrected for chromatic aberration between the 561 and 642 image channels by affine transformation obtained by least squares fitting of the centroid of fiducial beads imaged in both channels, and traces were assigned to nuclei classified as “interphase”, “early G1” or “mitosis”. \nThe resulting interphase and early G1 DNA traces were grouped into “WT” or “ΔSTAG2” based on their AF488 intensity and the subsequent analysis was performed as described in Beckwith et al., 2023 (Preprint). In brief, all fits were quality-controlled for their signal to background ratio, standard deviation of the fit and fit center distance to the regional barcode signal. Traces containing less than 20 high-quality fitted positions were removed from further analysis. Median pairwise distances were calculated for all 3D coordinates within a single trace and used to display either pairwise-distance maps or contact maps by calculating the frequency of contacts below a certain 3D distance (set to 120 nm). Difference matrices were achieved by subtraction of “dSTAG2” from “WT” pairwise distances. Scaling plots were generated from pairwise distance metrices as well, essentially plotting all measured 3D distances for every given genomic distance. \n",

      "description": "Cells for spot-bleach measurements were seeded at a density of 2.5x105 cells/ml into Ibidi glass bottom µ Slide channels (80607, Ibidi) and grown for 16-24 hours. One hour before imaging, DMEM was replaced by CO2-independent imaging medium (as above) containing 50-100 nM 5-SiR-Hoechst. FRAP experiments were performed on a LSM880 laser-scanning microscope with an inverted Axio Observer controlled by ZEN 2.1 Black software (Version 14.0.9.201, Zeiss), equipped with an in-house constructed incubation chamber for temperature control set to 37°C and using a C-Apochromat 40x/1.2 W Korr UV-Vis-IR water-immersion objective (421767-9971-711, Zeiss). Cells were screened at low-resolution live imaging in the SiR-Hoechst channel and image acquisition was started once a cell undergoing anaphase onset was identified. At 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 minutes after anaphase onset, an image of the dividing cell in the GFP (488 nm emission) and DNA (SiR-Hoechst, 633 nm emission) was acquired and used to place and initiate a 30 second continuous illumination with a diffraction limited focused laser beam (488 nm, ~1.5 µW laser power, corresponding to 0.1% Argon laser power). This resulted in a clear depletion of the chromatin-bound (m)EGFP-tagged protein pool (chromatin-bound = bound for more than the measurement period of 30 seconds) and minor bleaching of the overall cellular pool that readily replaced the bleached soluble fraction at the measured spot. Measurement timepoints were distributed between the two daughter cells to further minimize light exposure of a single cell. During the 30 seconds illumination, emitted fluorescence was continuously measured using the GaAsP detector in photon counting mode. The mean of the first (prebleach) and last (postbleach) 500 milliseconds of the fluorescence depletion trace was used to calculate the chromatin-bound fraction for each measurement based on the following formula: \nBound fraction =  (prebleach - postbleach)/prebleach  100\nIn addition to the measurements shortly after mitosis, chromatin-bound fractions of each POI were measured in asynchronous interphase cells. Measured bound fractions were calibrated using exogenously H2B-EGFP (low expression level, positive control representing ~100% chromatin bound fraction) and freely diffusing mEGFP (unbound control, representing 0% chromatin bound fraction) expressed in a HK WT cell background and measured in asynchronous interphase cell nuclei. The average calibrated chromatin-bound fractions of 10 spot-bleach measurements per protein per timepoint was interpolated (the asynchronous interphase measurements were set to 300 minutes after anaphase onset for this purpose) and used to calculate the average number of chromatin-bound POIs at each timepoint during mitotic exit using the FCS-calibrated protein number information from Fig. 1EF, Suppl. Fig. 1QP. \n",
