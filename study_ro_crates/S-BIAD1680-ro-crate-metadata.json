      "description": "Mitotic spindles are dynamically intertwined with the cytoplasm they assemble in. How the physicochemical properties of the cytoplasm affect spindle architecture and size remains largely unknown. Using quantitative biochemistry in combination with adaptive feedback microscopy, we investigated mitotic cell and spindle morphology during neural differentiation of embryonic stem cells. While tubulin biochemistry and microtubule dynamics remained unchanged, spindles changed their scaling behaviour: in differentiating cells, spindles were significantly smaller than those in equally-sized undifferentiated stem cells. Integrating quantitative phase imaging, biophysical perturbations and theory, we found that as cells differentiated, their cytoplasm became more dilute. The concomitant decrease in free tubulin activated CPAP (centrosomal P4.1-associated protein) to enhance the centrosomal nucleation capacity. As a consequence, in differentiating cells, microtubule mass shifted towards spindle poles at the expense of the spindle bulk, explaining the differentiation-associated switch in spindle architecture. This study shows that cell state-specific cytoplasmic density tunes mitotic spindle architecture. Thus, we reveal physical properties of the cytoplasm as a major determinant in organelle size control.",

A bleaching region of interest (ROI) of 4.4 x 1 µm spanning the spindle width at the half-distance between equator and pole was defined. Before and after bleaching, cells were imaged using the 488 nm laser (6.84 %), a photomultiplier tube with a gain of 760 V, in a field of view of 512 x 512, a zoom factor of 5.00 and a scanning speed of 400. One acquisition encompassed three frames pre-bleach à 1 second/frame, 1 second of bleach (488 nm at 100%) and 35 frames post-bleach à 1 second/frame. Signals within the bleached ROI were corrected for regular photobleaching during capture using a control ROI within the other half of the spindle, and min-max normalised. To determine recovery halftimes, the corrected data were fit to an exponential recovery function A * (1 - e(-t / tau)) + C using the scipy.optimize library. Halftimes were calculated by t1/2 = tau * ln 2. ",

While one beam was used as a reference beam, the sample was illuminated with the other using a 60x water-dipping objective lens (LUMPLFLN60XW, NA = 1.0, Olympus Life Science). Using a dual-axis galvanometer mirror (GVS012/M, Thorlabs Inc.), the sample was illuminated from 150 incident angles. After passing through the sample, the light was gathered by a 60x objective (numerical aperture = 1.35). At the image plane, the sample beam interfered with the reference beam to generate holograms. These were recorded by a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (FL3-U3-13Y3M-C, FLIR Systems, Inc.). To generate 3D tomograms, the holograms were reconstructed using a custom written MATLAB (github.com/OpticalDiffractionTomography).",

      "description": "We set up and used the adaptive feedback microscopy pipeline to automatically locate mitotic cells within a larger population of cells over days and image them in 3D with high resolution (see Figures 1e, f). The pipeline consists of 4 image acquisition jobs and 3 image analysis jobs as described below. The pipeline was driven by Zeiss ZEN Blue macros, controlling the acquisition process, and an analysis protocol set up in FIJI (Schindelin et al., 2012) using the AutoMicTools package. \n(1) Low-zoom autofocus. After moving the stage to the next predefined position in each imaging cycle, the focal plane was re-determined by using a reflection signal from the top surface of the coverslip. A fast XZ scan was performed using the piezo drive and the reflection signal was calculated by online image analysis and fed back to the microscope to trigger the acquisition of the low-zoom population image in focus. Settings: see Table X.\n(2) Low-zoom population image. Two-channel (DNA, GFP) overview images of cells at predefined positions in the wells with non-differentiating / differentiating cells were acquired by recording 2x2 tile scans with a 10% overlap and immediately stitched in the ZEN Blue software. Settings: see Table X. The stitched image was processed to identify positions of mitotic cells. \n(3) High-zoom autofocus. After receiving the xy coordinates of the positive hits, the pipeline determined the central focal plane for each mitotic cell for the subsequent high-content acquisition (4). For that purpose a stack at low lateral resolution, high zoom factor and extended z-range was automatically acquired for each cell in question. The online image analysis in AutoMicTools identified the mask of the tubulin::GFP-labelled spindle and found its brightest z section to correct lateral and axial position of a high resolution acquisition (see step 4). Settings: see Table X. \n(4) High-zoom single-cell image. Having received the final xzy coordinates, the positive hits were recorded in 2 channels with high spatial resolution. Settings: see Table X. \nFor one imaging cycle (interval of 10 min), the microscope moved to the first predefined xy position and recorded the low-zoom autofocus image (1) that was analysed using the AutoMicTools plugin in FIJI. The correct focal z plane was sent back to the microscope that subsequently performed job (2). In the dedicated AutoMicTools online image analysis job the GFP channel in the overview raw image was first maximum-projected.  Then positions of mitotic cells were identified using the Multi-Template Matching plugin (Thomas et al. 2020) where we provided a template for object detection of tubulin::GFP-labelled spindles from our previous data. We limited the number of positive hits to a maximum of 8. The list with the xy coordinates was fed back to the microscope to proceed with jobs (3) and (4) for each entry. Once completed, the cycle started anew at the next predefined position.",
