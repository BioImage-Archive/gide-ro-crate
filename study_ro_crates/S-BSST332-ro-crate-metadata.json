      "description": "Harmful algal blooms formed by colony-forming cyanobacteria deteriorate water resources by producing cyanotoxins, which frequently occur at high intracellular concentrations. We aimed to localize toxic microcystins (MCs) and bioactive anabaenopeptins (APs) at the subcellular level under noninvasive conditions. Since both metabolites are synthesized nonribosomally, the relaxed specificity of key enzymes catalyzing substrate activation allowed chemical labeling through a standard coppercatalyzed click chemistry reaction. The genera Planktothrix and Microcystis specifically incorporated unnatural amino acids such as N-L-propargyl-lysine or H-L-propargyl-tyrosine, resulting in modified AP or MC peptides carrying the incorporated alkyne moiety. The labeled cells were quantitatively differentiated from the unlabeled control cells. MCs and APs occurred intracellularly as distinct entities showing a cell-wide distribution but a lowered spatial overlap with natural autofluorescence. Using the immunofluorescence technique, colocalization with markers of individual organelles was utilized to relate the distribution of labeled MCs to cellular compartments, e.g., using RbcL and FtsZ (cytosol) and PsbA (thylakoids). The colocalization correlation coefficients calculated pairwise between organelles and autofluorescence were highly positive as opposed to the relatively low positive indices derived from labeled MCs. The lower correlation coefficients imply that only a portion of the labeled MC molecules\nwere related spatially to the organelles in the cell.",
