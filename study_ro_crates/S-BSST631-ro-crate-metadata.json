      "description": "U-2 OS knock-in cells were genereated using CRISPR to express CRY1 and/or PER2 fused to either mScarlet-I or mClover3 from the endogenous promoter. Cells were either left untreated or trasnduced with lentivirus expressing shRNA against either PER2 or CRY1 (pGIPZ clones V2LHS_172866 (CRY1) V2LHS_52938 (PER2) with mutated tGFP).\nCells were synchronized by washing them in cold PBS. Imging was performed on a Nikon widefield microscope for 24 h with an sampling interval of 1/h, starting 2.5 h after synchronization. Files are .nd2 and contain 4 channels:(1)RFP channel, (2)YFP channel, (3) a YFP/RFP channel (not used) (4) DIC channel. All files are stacks with 24 timepoints. nd2 file image stacks can be opened using the freeware Fiji/ImageJ, but also contain alot of metadata. For each cell line and condition, up to 5 imaging regions are provided.\nThe cells identifiers are as follows: 42: CRY1-mClover3, 44: CRY1-mScarlet-I, 56: PER2-mClover3. 58: PER2-mScarlet-I. 80: CRY1-mClover3/PER2-mScarlet-I.\nMore information on data acquisition and analysis can be found in the manuscript (doi provided after final publication) \n",
