      "description": "Multiple myeloma involves early dissemination of malignant plasma cells across the bone marrow; however, the initial steps of dissemination remain unclear. Human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs) stimulate myeloma cell expansion (e.g., IL-6) and simultaneously retain myeloma cells via chemokines (e.g., CXCL12) and adhesion factors. Hence, we hypothesized that the imbalance between cell division and retention drives dissemination. \nWe present an in vitro model using primary hMSCs co-cultured with INA-6 myeloma cells. Time-lapse microscopy revealed proliferation and attachment/detachment dynamics. Separation techniques (V-well adhesion assay and well plate sandwich centrifugation) were established to isolate MSC-interacting myeloma subpopulations that were characterized by RNAseq, cell viability and apoptosis. Results were correlated with gene expression data (n=837) and survival of myeloma patients (n=536). \nOn dispersed hMSCs, INA-6 saturate hMSC-surface before proliferating into large homotypic aggregates, from which single cells detached completely. On confluent hMSCs, aggregates were replaced by strong heterotypic hMSC-INA-6 interactions, which modulated apoptosis time-dependently. Only INA-6 daughter cells (nMA-INA6) detached from hMSCs by cell division but sustained adherence to hMSC-adhering mother cells (MA-INA6).\nIsolated nMA-INA6 indicated hMSC-autonomy through superior viability after IL­6 withdrawal and upregulation of proliferation-related genes. MA-INA6 upregulated adhesion and retention factors (CXCL12), that, intriguingly, were highly expressed in myeloma samples from patients with longer overall and progression-free survival, but their expression decreased in relapsed myeloma samples. \nAltogether, in vitro dissemination of INA-6 is driven by detaching daughter cells after a cycle of hMSC-(re)attachment and proliferation, involving adhesion factors that represent a bone marrow-retentive phenotype with potential clinical relevance.",

Movement speed of the motorized table was adjusted to the lowest setting that allows acquisition of the complete region within 15 minutes.\n",
      "labEquipment": "All microscopy equipment was acquired from ZEISS. The microscope was an Axio Observer 7 with confocal Apotome.2 equipped with a motorized reflector revolver and motorized scanning table (130x100 mm). The microscope was mounted on an Antivibrations-Set [Axio Observer (D)] with two antivibration carrier plates, each equipped with two vibration dampening feet. The light source was a microLED 2 for transmission light and (for fluorescence) Colibri 7 (R[G/Y]B-UV) for the green channel of incident light (590 nm). For excitation (EX) and emission (EM) light filtering and beam splitting (BS) we used the following reflector: 43 HE Cy 3 shift free (E) (EX: 550/25, BS: 570, EM: 605/70).\nLive cells were imaged inside an ibidi Stage Top Incubation System equilibrated to 80% humidity, 5% CO2 and 37 °C.",
