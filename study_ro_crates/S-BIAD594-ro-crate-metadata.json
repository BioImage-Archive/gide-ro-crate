      "description": "In neurons, many membrane proteins, synthesized in cell bodies, must be efficiently delivered to axons to influence neuronal connectivity, synaptic communication, and repair. Previously, we found that axonal targeting of TrkA neurotrophin receptors in sympathetic neurons occurs via an atypical transport mechanism called transcytosis, which relies on TrkA interactions with PTP1B, a protein tyrosine phosphatase. Here, we generated TrkAR685A mice, where TrkA receptor signaling is preserved, but its PTP1B-dependent transcytosis is disrupted, to show that this mode of axonal transport is essential for sympathetic neuron development and autonomic function. TrkAR685A mice have decreased axonal TrkA levels in vivo, developmental loss of sympathetic neurons, and reduced innervation of targets. Postnatal TrkAR685A mice exhibit reduced pupil size and eyelid ptosis, indicative of sympathetic dysfunction. These findings establish the necessity of transcytosis in supplying TrkA receptors to sympathetic axons and highlight the physiological relevance of this axon targeting mechanism in the nervous system.",

The same acquisition settings were applied to all images taken from a single experiment and analyzed by using ZEN 2012 (black edition) software. Axon images were captured as a snapshot of a single plane, and somas were captured in ~10 μm z-stacks. Intracellular accumulation of chimeric receptors was quantified as the number of FLAG-immuno-positive punctae per cell body or axon. Neurons were visualized using the GFP signal, and FLAG signals overlapping with GFP fluorescence were defined as internal receptors. For all imaging, a minimum of 10 cell bodies or axons were analyzed per condition per experiment. Results are expressed as means ± SEM and expressed relative to the “no ligand” condition",

Neurons were either completely deprived of NGF, or NGF (30 ng/ml) was added only to distal axons. BAF (50 μM) was also included to allow assessment of axon growth without the complications of cell death. Phase contrast images of axons were captured using a Retiga EXi camera in 24-hr intervals for 3 days on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope. Axon growth rate was measured using Openlab 4.0.4 for an average of 10-20 axons per condition. Axons were fixed in 4% PFA and stained with β-III-tubulin for representative images following experiments. Sympathetic ganglia for counting neuron number of Nissl stained tissues were obtained by imaging every 5th section of the ganglia in 10um sections using brightfield microscopy.",
