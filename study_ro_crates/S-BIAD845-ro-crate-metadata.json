      "description": "OME-NGFF converted study from idr0012.  Genetic screens for phenotypic similarity have made key contributions to associating genes with biological processes. With RNA interference (RNAi), highly parallel phenotyping of loss-of-function effects in cells has become feasible. One of the current challenges however is the computational categorization of visual phenotypes and the prediction of biological function and processes. In this study, we describe a combined computational and experimental approach to discover novel gene functions and explore functional relationships. We performed a genome-wide RNAi screen in human cells and used quantitative descriptors derived from high-throughput imaging to generate multiparametric phenotypic profiles. We show that profiles predicted functions of genes by phenotypic similarity. Specifically, we examined several candidates including the largely uncharacterized gene DONSON, which shared phenotype similarity with known factors of DNA damage response (DDR) and genomic integrity. Experimental evidence supports that DONSON is a novel centrosomal protein required for DDR signalling and genomic integrity. Multiparametric phenotyping by automated imaging and computational annotation is a powerful method for functional discovery and mapping the landscape of phenotypic responses to cellular perturbations.",

For high_throughput screening, plates were loaded onto the microscope with a Twister II Microplate robotic arm. Images of four different positions in each well were acquired, each containing channels for Hoechst (DNA), Alexa 488 (tubulin) and TRITC (actin). Each image had a resolution of 670 _ 510 pixels with each channel at 12_bit intensity resolution. The total number of cells measured in a well was typically around 300. For the primary screen, a total of 22 839 wells were imaged in four spots each, using three channels, resulting in 274 068 grey scale images. The combination of the three channels leads to 91 356 three_colour images.",
