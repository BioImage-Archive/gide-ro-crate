      "description": "Phenotype imaging parameters:\nDAPI images were taken with 405 nm excitation at 60% power, a 435-480nm emission filter, and 40 ms exposure time. GFP/SNAP-tag images were taken with 488 nm excitation at 15% power, a 435-550nm emission filter, and 40 ms exposure time. For live-cell time lapse experiments, we collected images for eight z-slices, spaced 1 µm apart, at each position. For all other screens, we collected images at a single z-plane.\n\nSBS imaging parameters:\nDAPI images were taken with 405 nm laser excitation, 10% power, 70 ms exposure time, with a custom Chroma polychroic (ZT408/473/545/635/750/RPC_UF2), and custom Magnatron penta barrier filter for Celesta (ZET408/473/545/635/750m). MiSeq G images were taken with 518 nm laser excitation, 25% laser power, 200 ms exposure time, with a Chroma T525LPXR dichroic, and Chroma ET560/40x filter. MiSeq T images were taken with 545 nm laser excitation, 22% laser power, 200 ms exposure time, with a custom Chroma polychroic (ZT408/473/545/635/750/RPC_UF2), and custom Magnatron penta barrier filter for Celesta (ZET408/473/545/635/750m). MiSeq A images were taken with 640 nm laser excitation, 19% laser power, 200 ms exposure time, with a custom Chroma polychroic (ZT408/473/545/635/750/RPC_UF2), and custom Magnatron penta barrier filter for Celesta (ZET408/473/545/635/750m). MiSeq C images were taken with 640 nm laser excitation, 30% laser power, 200 ms exposure time, with a Chroma T647ILPXR dichroic, and Chroma ET720/60m filter. For the final SBS cycle, images were also collected in the GFP channel (475 nm laser excitation, 15%/4% (SNAP-tag/GFP) laser power, 300/100 ms (SNAP-tag/GFP) exposure time, green filter) to assist with matching SBS images to phenotype images. All images were collected with 2x2 pixel binning, with a 10x CFI Plan Apo Lambda objective (Nikon MRD00105).",
      "labEquipment": "All phenotype imaging was performed on an Opera Phenix High-Content Screening System (PerkinElmer) with a 40x water immersion objective in confocal mode. In situ SBS imaging was performed on a Nikon Ti2-E inverted microscope with automated stage control, a Photometrics Iris 9 camera, and fluorescence illumination with a Lumencor Celesta light engine coupled with a liquid light guide to a 0.9 mm2 illumination at the rear port of the scope.
