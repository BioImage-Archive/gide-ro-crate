      "description": "The resin block containing the cells was fixed to a stub using carbon paste and abraded on the surface with a diamond knife in a microtome to create a perfectly clean and flat surface. The entire sample was coated with a 4 nm layer of platinum to prevent charging during observation. Inside the FIB-SEM, a second platinum layer (1–2 µm) was locally deposited on the analysed area to mitigate possible curtaining artefacts. The sample was then abraded slice by slice with the Ga⁺ ion beam (typically at a current of 700 nA and an acceleration voltage of 30 kV). Each freshly exposed surface was imaged using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) at 1.5 kV and with a current of ~1 nA, with the in-lens EsB backscatter detector being used for this purpose. For the algae sample, we generally used simultaneous milling and imaging for greater stability, with hourly automatic correction of focus and astigmatism. A thickness of 8 nm was removed for each slice, and SEM images were recorded with a pixel size of 8 nm, providing an isotropic voxel size of 8 × 8 × 8 nm³. Whole volumes were imaged with 800–1,000 frames, depending on the species. Due to the smaller dimensions of the cells, the voxel size was reduced to 4 × 4 × 4 nm³ in the case of Micromonas, resulting in higher-resolution datasets comprising approximately 350–500 frames per cell.",
