      "description": "The cyanoHAB forming cyanobacteria Microcystis and Planktothrix frequently produce high intracellular amounts of microcystins (MCs) or anabaenopeptins (APs). In this study, chemically modified MCs and APs have been localized on a subcellular level in Microcystis and Planktothrix applying copper-catalyzed alkyne-azide cycloaddition (CuACC). For this purpose, three different non-natural amino acids carrying alkyne or azide moieties were fed to individual P. agardhii strains No371/1 and CYA126/8 as well as to M. aeruginosa strain Hofbauer showing promiscuous incorporation of various amino acid substrates during non-ribosomal peptide synthesis (NRPS). Moreover, CYA126/8 peptide knock-out mutants and non-toxic strain Synechocystis PCC6803 were processed under identical conditions. Simultaneous labelling of modified peptides with ALEXA405 and ALEXA488 and lipid staining with BODIPY 505/515 were performed to investigate the intracellular location of the modified peptides. Pearson correlation coefficients (PCC) obtained from confocal images were calculated between the different fluorophores and the natural autofluorescence (AF), and between labelled modified peptides and dyed lipids to investigate the spatial overlap between peptides and the photosynthetic complex, and between peptides and lipids. Overall, labelling of modified MCs (M. aeruginosa) and APs (P. agardhii) using both fluorophores revealed in-creased intensity in MC/AP producing strains. For Synechocystis lacking NRPS, no labelling using either ALEXA405 or ALEXA488 was observed. Lipid staining in M. aeruginosa and Synechocystis was intense while in Planktothrix it was more variable. When compared with AF, both modified peptides and lipids showed a heterologous distribution. In comparison, the correlation between stained lipids and labelled peptides was not increased suggesting a reduced spatial overlap.",

      "description": "5 µl of the samples were mounted using antifade solution (ProLong® Diamond Antifade Mountant, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Darmstadt, Germany). The samples were air-dried for 48 h in the dark and stored at 4 °C until microscopical analysis. For the image acquisition, a DMI 6000 SP8 (Leica Microsystems was used microscope, with an 93× HCX Plan Apo 1.4 glycerol objective was used. Images were acquired with a sequential scan using the following laser configuration\n405nm (Em 415-584 nm), 495nm (Em 500-580 nm), 620 nm (Em 680-730 nm). Excitation at 405 nm (Ch0) was used for measuring intensities of ALEXA 405 labelled modified cyanopeptides, excitation at 495 nm (Ch1) was used for measuring intensities of ALEXA 488 labelled modified cyanopeptides and BODIPY 505/515 labelled lipids, while excitation at 620 nm (Ch2) was used for measuring the intrinsic natural autofluorescence of the cells.\n\nAn initial set of images was taken with a digital magnification of 1.25x, while three-dimensional images were acquired at a digital magnification of 10.5x to a resolution of 50 nm per voxel in the XY axis and 150 nm at the Z axis. Confocal images were deconvolved to improve final resolution with Huygens Essential 20.04 software using the Classic Maximum Likelihood Estimation (CMLE) algorithm, according to the manufacturer’s recommendations (Science Volume Imaging BV, Hilversum, The Netherlands).\nFinally, total intensities were obtained and compiled for the three RGB channels, as well as the ratios between the different channels. Specifically, the green channel (Ch1) was used to measure the labelling with ALEXA488 and BODIPY 505/515, the blue channel (Ch0) measured the labelling effect with ALEXA405, while the red channel (Ch2) was used to measure the autofluorescence (AF) of the cells. \n\n",
