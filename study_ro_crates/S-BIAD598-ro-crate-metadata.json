      "description": "Tara Expeditions are global scientific voyages that probe morphological and molecular diversity, evolution and ecology of marine plankton to explore how they are impacted by changes in the Earth's climate. The first expeditions collected samples of marine plankton containing viruses, bacteria, archaea, protists and planktonic metazoans living in the photic layer of the world's oceans. These expeditions, the first taking place between 2009 and 2013, include Tara Oceans: a global view, and Tara Oceans Polar Circle, both of which followed the same sampling protocol. \nThis dataset includes 1074 pictures of 284 planktonic taxa (mainly microalgae and other Ciliate and Radiolarian protists) collected from the vicinity of the Marquesas Islands in the Southern Pacific Ocean during the Tara Oceans expedition. Multiple samples particularly of the size fractions 5-20 and 20 180 um from four sites and two depths were processed with different methods and studied in detail using scanning electron microscopy.",

      "description": "In order to improve species identification, samples from surface and DCM falling into the size classes 0.8–5 µm, 5–20 µm and 20–180 µm were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Formaldehyde-preserved samples were carefully filtered through 3 µm-pore size Nucleopore™ polycarbonate membrane filters using a Swinnex filter holder (13 mm) screwed on a syringe and gravity sedimentation. Samples were then washed with distilled water, dehydrated in an ethanol series (25%, 50%, 75%, 95% and 100%) and dried using a critical point dryer. Dried filters were mounted on aluminum stubs, sputter-coated with gold-palladium, and observed using a Philips 505.\n          Formaldehyde-, glutaraldehyde- and ethanol-preserved samples were used for additional detailed examination using high-resolution SEM JEOL 7401F. Sample preparation varied based on the fixative chemical and due to testing of various protocols. For cryo-sublimation, 1–2 ml of a formaldehyde- or glutaraldehyde-preserved sample was carefully centrifuged in a MilliporeTM Ultrafree®-CL Centrifugal Filter Unit with a PVDF membrane (pore size 0.1 µm) for 3 min at 1,000 rpm. After that, the pellet was incubated for 5 min in 1 ml of sterile seawater, and again centrifuged for 2–3 min at 1,000 rpm. Throughout the procedure, it was ensured that the filter did not get completely dry. This washing step was repeated 3 times. Next, the sample was post-fixed for 30 min with a mixture of 2% OsO4 in 0.5 ml sterile sea water and centrifuged for 2 min at 1,000 rpm. It was then washed 3 times as described above. Finally, the centrifugation unit was cut open and the membrane with the sample was quickly but carefully removed and placed immediately into liquid nitrogen. Cryo-sublimation took place in a cryo-attachment Alto2500 (Gatan) connected directly with SEM or in a modified freeze dryer evacuated with a rotary pump for 5-6 hrs. In the critical point drying protocol, the first steps were identical with the cry-sublimation procedure up to the post-fixation step with 2% OsO4. Post-fixed samples were dropped onto coverslips coated with polylysine and were dehydrated in an acetone series (30%, 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, and 100%). Ethanol-preserved samples were transferred directly into 100% ethanol and dried using a critical point dryer machine. Regardless of the preparation method, dried filters were mounted on aluminum stubs, sputter-coated with gold-palladium and examined by high-resolution SEM JEOL 7401F working in a GBL mode with the landing energy of primary electrons of 4 kV. Images were captured by the detector of secondary electrons (Everhart-Thornley detector) placed at the side of the SEM chamber. ",
