      "description": "OME-NGFF converted study from idr0051.  Light sheet microscopy has been previously used to image and directly study the process of gastrulation in a zebrafish embryo. Before now it was not possible to use this method to study late-stage somatogenesis, due to the movement of the embryo, resulting in displacement from the field of view. Here we achieve 4D light sheet imaging with online, image based registration to maintain the field of view during long timelapses, with emphasis on the tailbud. The zebrafish tailbud is of special interest as it contains a population of bipotent progenitor cells, neuromesodermal progenitors (NMps), competent to enter either the mesodermal or neural lineages. This dataset provides in toto tracking of the tailbud of the developing zebrafish whilst also demonstrating the potential of online tracking during developing to maintain high magnification images whilst tracking a growing object.",

      "description": "The additional light-sheet imaging was performed using a home-build scanning light-sheet microscope in an upright geometry, where the excitation and emission lenses were each tilted 45° to the vertical axis to allow for horizontal sample placement on a xyz-translation stage. The sheet was generated using 2-4% laser output power at 488 nm (200 mW maximum output power), delivered to the sample using a Nikon 10×, 0.3NA water-immersion objective and a galvo scanning system (Cambridge Technology). The sheet thickness determined before the experiment in dye solution was ∼2 μm at the waist. Fluorescence was collected with a Nikon 40×, 0.8 NA water-immersion objective, using a 525/50 nm (Chroma Technologies) emission filter in front of the sCMOS camera (Hamamatsu Flash 4). The position of the detection lens was synchronized with the position of the excitation sheet using a long travel piezo objective positioner (Physik Instrumente).",
