DAPI, BFP, GFP, and mCherry were excited using a 390/22nm, 390/22nm, 475/28nm and 575/25nm LED, respectively.\n\nFor the microfluidic experiments (strain CJW7323), the excitation light intensity was reduced to 20% for the 1-min interval and 30% for the 3-min interval imaging of the RplA-GFP and HupA-mCherry. An exposure time of 120-ms was used for both markers. In all time-lapse experiments, a neutral density filter (absorptive ND filter, OD:1.3 / 5% transmission, NE13B by Thorlabs) was also applied to reduce the LED power and minimize phototoxicity and photobleaching. The LED powers (factored by the neutral density filters) were calibrated using a microscope slide power meter with an 18×18 mm sensor size (S170C by Thorlabs). The light intensity was measured for each excitation wavelength (475/28nm and 575/25nm) at the end of the objective (without immersion oil) for different LED intensities (% of maximum intensity). From the generated calibration curves, the RplA-GFP excitation light power was estimated to be 524 μW and 629 μW for the 1-min and 3-min fluorescence interval imaging, respectively. HupA-mCherry was excited with 109 μW light power for the 1-min and 191 μW for the 3-min fluorescence interval imaging.\n\nThe type N immersion oil (by Nikon) was used in all experiments except for the time-lapse observation of A22+cephalexin-treated cells where the type F immersion oil (by Nikon) was used. All imaging (time-lapse and snapshots) was done at 30⁰C.",

For the DAPI, BFP, GFP, or mCherry channels, a polychroic mirror (FF-409/493/596-Di02 by Shemrock) combined with a triple-pass emitter (FF-1-432/523/702-25 by Shemrock) was used. For DAPI, BFP, and GFP imaging, additional emission filters were applied in the optical path (FF01-432-36 by Shemrock, FF01-432-36 by Shemrock and ET525/50M by Chroma, respectively). DAPI, BFP, GFP, and mCherry were excited using a 390/22nm, 390/22nm, 475/28nm and 575/25nm LED, respectively.",
