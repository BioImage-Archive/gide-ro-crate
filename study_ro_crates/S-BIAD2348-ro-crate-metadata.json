After rinsing with sodium phosphate buffer (PB, 100 mM, pH7.4), fixed tissues were then post-fixed with 1% osmium tetraoxide in PB. After rinsing with high-purity water, water was removed from the tissue in successive gradient washes ethanol (25%, 50%, 75%, and 95%) and embedded in epoxy resin overnight (60 °C). Ultrathin sections were cut using Leica EM UC7 and collected on carbon-coated copper grids.
