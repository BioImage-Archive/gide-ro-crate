Striatal brain sections were then stained with antibodies against bassoon to analyze the number and organization of active zone sites in Aldh1a1+ (EYFP+) or Aldh1a1- (mCherry+) axons from the same mouse. Due to the high signal of bassoon in the striatum, we used structured illumination microscopy (SIM) for improved resolution, followed by 3D reconstruction analysis.",

The acquisition settings were set to 10 MHz, and 16 bit depth with electron multiplication (EM) gain and no binning. Exposure times ranged between 200 and 900 ms, with the EM gain multiplier kept below 1500. The conversion gain was maintained at 1x. The laser power was adjusted to keep LUTs within the first quarter of the scale. LUTS were kept similar across comparisons. \nSingle images were processed and analyzed using Nikon Elements software. 3D reconstructions in a single plane used nine images captured with 2D SIM and reconstructed with 3D SIM to increase xy and z resolution were generated by Nikon Element, and the illumination modulation contrast was set automatically by the software.
