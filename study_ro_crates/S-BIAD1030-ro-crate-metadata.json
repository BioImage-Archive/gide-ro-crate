      "description": "Background  \tFetal growth restriction (FGR) is a pregnancy complication in which a newborn fails to achieve its growth potential, increasing the risk of perinatal morbidity and mortality.  Chronic maternal gestational hypoxia, as well as placental insufficiency are associated with increased FGR incidence; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying FGR remain unknown. \nMethods  \t Pregnant mice were subjected to acute or chronic hypoxia (12.5% O2) resulting in reduced fetal weight.  Placenta oxygen transport was assessed by blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The placentae were analyzed via immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization.  Human placentae were selected from FGR and matched controls and analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Maternal and cord sera were analyzed by mass spectrometry. \nResults\t\tWe show that murine acute and chronic gestational hypoxia recapitulates FGR phenotype and affects placental structure and morphology. Gestational hypoxia decreased labyrinth area, increased the incidence of red blood cells (RBCs) in the labyrinth while expanding the placental spiral arteries (SpA) diameter. Hypoxic placentae exhibited higher hemoglobin-oxygen affinity compared to the control. Placental abundance of Bisphosphoglycerate mutase (BPGM) was upregulated in the syncytiotrophoblast and spiral artery trophoblast cells (SpA TGCs) in the murine gestational hypoxia groups compared to the control. Hif1a levels were higher in the acute hypoxia group compared to the control. In contrast, human FGR placentae exhibited reduced BPGM levels in the syncytiotrophoblast layer compared to placentae from healthy uncomplicated pregnancies. Levels of 2,3 BPG, the product of BPGM, were lower in cord serum of human FGR placentae compared to control. Polar expression of BPGM, was found in both human and mouse placentae syncytiotrophoblast, with higher expression facing the maternal circulation. Moreover, in the murine SpA TGCs expression of BPGM was concentrated exclusively in the apical cell side, in direct proximity to the maternal circulation. \nConclusions\tThis study suggests a possible involvement of placental BPGM in maternal-fetal oxygen transfer, and in the pathophysiology of FGR.\n",

      "description": "Anatomic data to determine optimal animal positioning was acquired by using a short Gradient Recalled Echo (GRE) sequence with imaging slices acquired in three orthogonal planes. The animals were positioned to maximize the number of fetuses that could be viewed while still observing maternal liver. The duration of the MRI measurements at each oxygen level was approximately 20 min. After the O2 concentration was reduced, a 2 minute interval was given before acquiring the next set of MRI images, allowing R2* stabilization.  At each oxygen phase, the nitrogen level was adjusted to maintain a constant flow of inhaled gas. To determine R2* values three Gradient Recalled Echo (GRE) acquisitions were performed with TE= 1.6 ms, 2.6 ms and 3.6 ms. The parameters for these GRE measurements were as follows: 48 slices with slice thickness of 0.4 mm with 0.1 mm inter-slice gap, field of view 4.2 X 3.3 cm2, pulse flip angle 40°, matrix size 280 x 220 (150 x 150 um2 pixel size), 2 averages (motion averaging). Images were acquired with fat suppression and RF spoiling. The excitation pulse was 0.5 ms (6400 Hz bandwidth) and the acquisition bandwidth was 200 kHz. The slice order was interleaved. The sequence was respiration triggered (per slice) with an approximate TR of 800 ms.",
