      "description": "Data, image analysis pipelines and code as described in the publication entitled: \"Immunocompetent Cell Targeting by Food-Additive Titanium Dioxide\".\n\nABSTRACT\nFood-grade titanium dioxide (fgTiO2) is a bio-persistent particle under intense regulatory scrutiny. Paradoxically, meaningful in vivo cellular accumulation has never been demonstrated: the only known cell reservoirs for fgTiO2 are ‘graveyard’ intestinal pigment cells which are metabolically and immunologically quiescent.  Here we identify major new immunocompetent cell targets of fgTiO2 in humans, most notably in the subepithelial dome region of intestinal Peyer’s patches. Using multimodal microscopy techniques with single-particle detection and per-cell / vesicle image analysis we achieved correlative dosimetry, quantitatively recapitulating human cellular exposures in the terminal ileum of mice fed a fgTiO2-containing diet. Epithelial microfold cells selectively funneled fgTiO2 into LysoMac and LysoDC cells with ensuing accumulation. Notwithstanding, proximity extension analyses for 92 protein targets revealed no measureable perturbation of cell signalling pathways. When chased with oral ΔaroA-Salmonella, pro-inflammatory signalling was confirmed, but no augmentation by fgTiO2 was revealed despite marked same-cell loading. Interestingly, Salmonella caused the fgTiO2-recipient cells to migrate basolaterally in the patch and, sporadically, to the lamina propria, thereby fully recreating the intestinal tissue distribution of fgTiO2 in humans. Immunocompetent cells that accumulate fgTiO2 in vivo are now identified and we demonstrate a mouse model that finally enables human-relevant risk assessments of ingested, bio-persistent (nano)particles.\n",
