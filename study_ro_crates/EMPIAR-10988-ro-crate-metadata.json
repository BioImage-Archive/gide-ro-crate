A calibrated pixel size of 3.37 Å was used. Up to 14 tilt series were collected on a single lamella in low dose mode using SerialEM. Starting from the lamella pre-tilt, images were acquired in 2° increments within a range of +58° to −40° using a dose-symmetric tilt scheme with a constant electron dose per tilt image. For ground truth data, a set of ten tilt series were collected with a 70 μm objective aperture.",
