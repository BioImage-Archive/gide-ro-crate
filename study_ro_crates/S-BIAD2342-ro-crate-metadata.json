      "description": "The nucleolus is a biomolecular condensate essential for ribosome biogenesis and cellular stress response, and it is a key target for many DNA viruses. However, little is known about how autonomous parvovirus infection impacts nucleolar structure and function. Here, we used advanced imaging techniques, including ten-fold robust expansion microscopy (TREx), cryo soft X-ray tomography (Cryo-SXT), and interactomics and biochemical approaches, to study nucleolar remodeling during canine parvovirus infection. Infection led to redistribution of nucleolar upstream binding transcription factor 1 (inner core), fibrillarin (middle layer), and Ki-67 (outer rim). In contrast, peripheral nucleolar proteins (nucleolin and nucleophosmin) and precursor ribosomal RNAs (pre-rRNAs) remain in  spherical structures. TREx and Cryo-SXT microscopy revealed profound nucleolar structural changes, including thickened perinucleolar chromatin and enlarged nucleolar low-protein density channels. BioID identified interactions between viral NS2 and nucleolar proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis. Northern blotting demonstrated a slowdown in ribosome biogenesis during infection. Collectively, these findings provide novel insights into how parvoviruses remodel nucleolar structure and function. ",

Alexa488 and Alexa546 were excited with 499 nm and 557 nm wavelengths of pulsed white light laser (80 MHz). The emission detection range was adjusted to 505-561 nm for Alexa488 and 568-648 nm for Alexa546. The image resolution was 512 x 512 or 1024 x 1024 pixels, with a pixel size between 30-60 nm in the x- and y-directions and 180-300 nm in the z-direction. A fixed optical configuration was used to acquire all images of the same sample set.\n\nFig2. rRNA: Microscopy images were acquired by exciting DAPI with a 405 nm diode laser and collecting with a 450/50 nm band-pass filter. Alexa488 was excited with a 488 nm argon laser, and the fluorescence was collected with a 515/30 nm band-pass filter. Alexa 546 was excited with a 561 nm sapphire laser and detected with a 595/50 nm band-pass filter. The image resolution was 512 x 512 pixels, with a pixel size between 30 nm in the x- and y-directions and 180 nm in the z-direction. A fixed optical configuration was used to acquire all images of the same sample set.\n\nFig3. Expansion microscopy: Images of expansion samples were acquired with a Leica SP8 confocal microscope using the 63x water immersion objective (1.2 NA). DAPI was excited with a 405 nm laser and detected with a PMT detector at 412-480 nm. Alexa 488 was excited with a 499 nm laser and detected at 506-552 nm using a Leica HyD SMD detector. Alexa 546 was excited with a 557 nm laser and detected at 566-611 nm using a Leica HyD SMD detector. The total protein stain was excited with a 645 nm laser and detected at 652-800 nm using a Leica HyD SMD detector. The pixel size was 90 nm in the x- and y-directions and 356 nm in the z-direction.\n\nFig4. Soft X-Ray Tomography: Using a compact soft X-ray microscope, the pre-vitrification-located infected cells were re-located by a low magnification SXT imaging, and a built-in cryo-fluorescence microscopy from the vitrified grids, and tomographic tilt-series of infected cells were collected (SXT100, Sirius XT, Dublin, IRE, https://siriusxt.com/) (O’Connor et al., 2024; Fahy et al., 2021). The tilt series were acquired assets of X-ray projections covering a 120° tilt range with one-degree increments. The exposure per projection ranged from 15 to 60 seconds, depending on the sample ice thickness and tilt angle. The exposure time was increased to 120 seconds at high tilt angles for samples with particularly thick ice. The samples were maintained at temperatures of -163°C or lower throughout all experimental stages\n\nFig5. Proximity ligation assay: DAPI was excited with a 405 nm diode laser, and the fluorescence was collected with a 450/50 nm band-pass filter. PLA signals were excited with a 561 nm sapphire laser, and the fluorescence was collected with a 595/50 nm band-pass filter.
