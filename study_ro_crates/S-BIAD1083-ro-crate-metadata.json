      "description": "While commensal bacteria generally respect natural barriers of the human body, pathogens are able to breach epithelia, invade deeper tissue layers and cause life-threatening infections. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic human pathogen, is a leading cause of severe hospital-acquired pneumonia, with mortality rates up to 50% in mechanically ventilated patients1–3. Effective colonization and breaching of lung mucosa are hallmarks of P. aeruginosa pathogenesis4. Although virulence factors and behavioral strategies of P. aeruginosa have been described5,6, it has remained unclear how this pathogen disseminates on functional mucosal surfaces, how it avoids mucociliary clearance and how it invades the tissue barrier. Using fully differentiated human lung epithelia, we demonstrate that P. aeruginosa efficiently spreads on the apical tissue surface before it breaches epithelia by preferentially invading mucus secreting goblet cells. Internalization leads to host cell death and expulsion and the formation of ruptures of the epithelial barrier. Rupture sites are rapidly colonized by extracellular bacteria through active chemotaxis, leading to increasing tissue damage and successful pathogen translocation to the unprotected basolateral side of the epithelium. We show that cell invasion is promoted by two Type-6 toxin secretion systems (T6SS), while Type-3 (T3SS) mediates cell death of infected goblet cells. T3SS mutants invade goblet cells normally, but internalized bacteria fail to trigger goblet cell expulsion and instead show unrestrained intracellular replication. While the effective shedding of infected host cells reveals potent tissue protection mechanisms, the discovery of an intracellular lifestyle of P. aeruginosa in pseudostratified human lung epithelia provides new entry points into investigating the intersection of antibiotic and immune mechanisms during lung infections. By demonstrating that P. aeruginosa uses a combination of specific virulence factors and collective behavior to invade goblet cells and breach the lung tissue barrier from within, these studies reveal novel mechanisms underlying lung infection dynamics under physiological conditions.

The samples were washed 3 times with 0.1 M PIPES buffer pH7.2, for 10 min. Samples were post-fixed in 1% buffered osmium tetroxide for 1 h at 4°C, rinsed in buffer, rinsed in water, then en bloc stained with aqueous Uranyl Acetate for 1 h at 4°C in the dark. Samples were dehydrated in an ethanol series (30, 50, 70, 95% and 100%). After three changes of absolute ethanol, samples were washed in acetone and embedded in a mixture of resin/acetone first and then in pure Epon 812 resin overnight. Embedding is carried out into an oven at 60°C for 48 hours. Semi-thin sections are cut from blocks with a glass knife and the blocks are selected for thinning. Seventy nm thin sections were cut with diamond knives and placed on copper grids, coated with Parlodion film and carbon layer, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate.

To visualize apoptotic cells, after CellMask™ Deep Red staining, the lung tissue was stained with 5 µM NucView® 488 Caspase-3 Substrate (Biotium) for 40 min, then imaged in a Delta T Transwell Insert Adapter (Bioptechs).

      "labEquipment": "Samples were imaged using a Nikon CSU-W1 equipped with a 2x Hamamatsu ORCA-Fusion camera (sCMOS) and CFP Plan Apo Lambda 10x/0.45 or CFI Plan Apo Lambda S 25x/1.05 silicon objective. Images were stored and analyzed using OMERO. Alternatively, samples were imaged with an Olympus SpinSR or SpinD, Olympus IX83 stand, Hamamatsu ORCA-Fusion sCMOS camera, Yokogawa CSU-W1 confocal scan head (50um disk) and UPL S APO 30x/1.05 silicone objective.
