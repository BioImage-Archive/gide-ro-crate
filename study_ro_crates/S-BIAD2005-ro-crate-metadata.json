      "description": "The data includes images recorded via a towed video frame in the Belgian Part of the North Sea. They show the seafloor, captured at a perpendicular angle, as well as various organisms living on it. Furthermore, text files containing point annotations of the organisms created with the program \"papara(zz)i\" are included. A label tree exported from the web tool \"BIIGLE\" is included as well. The goal of the associated project was to transform the existing point annotations to polygons and to attach a label from the included label tree to the newly created annotations. \n\nThis data was selected as part of the AI4Life Open Calls 2023 for image analysis consultation and deep-learning applications.",

      "description": "Footage was recorded with GoPro Hero 9 cameras set to 4k resolution, linear mode, and 60 fps. The cameras were attached on the video frame so that they recorded the seafloor at a perpendicular angle. Care was taken that the video frame was towed at a speed of no more than 0.3 to 0.5 knots to reduce motion blur. From the videos, still images were extracted every 5 seconds to avoid overlap. A quality control was performed to remove images that were blurry, showed only sediment, or were distorted in any other way to the point were species identification became to difficult. \n\n",
