      "description": "Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). PadFISH is a multiplex padlock probe-based smFISH method that integrates the hybridization-based in situ sequencing (HybISS) and the single-cell resolution in situ hybridization on tissues (SCRINSHOT). In this study, we employed this technique to trace nascent RNAs using intronic padlock probes (PLPs) targeting their cDNA and to detect their rolling circle amplification (RCA) product through subsequent Bridge Probe (BP) and Detection Oligo (DO) hybridization\nFor padFISH we used fixed cells stored in PBS. Cells underwent permeabilization with 0.1 M HCl for 3 minutes at room temperature (RT), followed by three 1-minute washes in PBS/Tween 0.05% (PBST). Subsequently, blocking mix with 20% formamide was added for 30 minutes at RT, then washed twice for 1 minute with PBST. When needed, primary probes were phosphorylated via T4 Polynucleotide Kinase (cat. M0201S, New England Biolabs); non-radioactive phosphorylation reaction was carried at 37°C for 30 minutes according to manufacturer’s protocol. For PLP hybridization, we applied a solution containing 20% formamide and 50 nM of each probe, then incubated the slides for 15 minutes at 55 °C followed by 2 hours at 45 °C. After hybridization, cells were washed three times for 10-minute with 10% formamide in 2x SSC at 45 °C, and then three times for 1-minute with PBST. To ligate standard PLPs, the sample was incubated with 0.5 U/ml of SplintR ligase (cat. #M0375L, New England Biolabs) for 15 minutes at 25 °C. After ligation, cells were washed twice for 1 minute in PBST. RCA was performed by incubating the sample overnight at 30 °C with NxGen Phi29 DNA polymerase (cat. #30221-2, LGC Biosearch Technologies) and 0.1 uM RCA primer (purchased as 100 nmol DNA oligonucleotide from IDT). To ligate PLPs with a single RNA-nucleotide, cells were incubated with 0.5 U/ml T4 RNA ligase (cat. #M0239L, New England Biolabs) and in presence of 0.1 uM RCA primer for 2h at 37°C. Afterwards, cells were washed twice for 1 minute in PBST. RCA was performed as described above, only in absence of RCA primer. After RCA, cells were washed three times for 1 minute in PBST and subsequently fixed in 4% PFA for 15 minutes at RT. After three additional PBST washing steps, cells were incubated with 65% formamide in 2x SSC at 30 °C. Usual PBST washes and an additional washing step in 2x SSC were carried out before secondary hybridization. BP and DO hybridization were performed according to the L-probes HybISS Protocol (Gyllborg et. al, 2020). For BP hybridization, we added a solution of 4x SSC, 40% formamide and 0.1 M of each barcode 0.1 mM to the wells and incubated them for 1 hour at RT. Excess probes were removed by washing with 2x SSC. DO hybridization using 0.1 mM of each barcoded dye was carried out simultaneously with 5 uM DAPI staining for 1 hour at RT. Excess DOs were removed by washing three times with PBS and cells were stored in PBS at 4 °C until imaging.",
