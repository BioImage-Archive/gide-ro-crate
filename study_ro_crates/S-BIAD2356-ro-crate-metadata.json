      "description": "The mechanisms regulating gamete fusion and preventing polyspermy in mammalian fertilization remain incompletely understood. This study combines real-time imaging, confocal microscopy and statistical analysis to investigate fertilization and polyspermy prevention dynamics in mice. By tracking the behavior of over one hundred spermatozoa entering the perivitelline space of oocytes, we dissect the respective contributions of oocyte structures (zona pellucida (ZP), perivitelline space (PVS), oolemma) and sperm components (head, flagellum) to fertilization and polyspermy prevention. We find that fertilization requires specific sperm head movements on the oolemma, driven by flagellar beating and facilitated by trapping the flagellum in the ZP, revealing a novel role for this structure. Our kinetic analysis characterizes a slow “penetration block” that gradually limits sperm entry into the PVS and a faster “fusion block” that prevents further fusion events. As the penetration block becomes significant after the fusion block is established, only the latter effectively prevents polyspermy in mice. We propose that it acts through neutralization of excess sperm in the PVS by oocyte-derived proteins CD9 and JUNO found coating non-fertilizing spermatozoa.",

      "description": "Oocytes —together with their associated ZP-bound spermatozoa—were isolated 15 minutes after insemination and transferred individually into microdrops of fertilization medium to enable identification. These oocytes were gently immobilized using a pipette and observed in bright field sequentially at high magnification (x40 objective) over a period of approximately 4 hours. When relevant, the observation sequences were recorded at 136 fps using an IDS imaging camera (model UI-3040SE Monochrome,) using uEye capture software. The duration of each observational sequence could vary from less than one minute when no sperm penetration into the PVS or interaction with the oolemma was in progress, to typically around 10 minutes when such events were in progress. Consequently, as in average 5 oocytes were observed in turn, the interval between two rounds of observation of a given oocyte could range from a few minutes to more than an hour.\nThen the oocytes were stain with Hoechst and imaged with Leica SP5 confocal, objective x40 oil, Z-stack (step 2 micrometer) laser diode 405nm",
