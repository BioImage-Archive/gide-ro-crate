However, the desired engineering often requires that the barcodes used for in situ genotyping are expressed from the chromosome. This has not previously been achieved in bacteria. Here we describe a method for in situ genotyping of libraries with genomic barcodes in Escherichia coli. The method is applied to measure the intracellular maturation time of 84 red fluorescent proteins.\n\nInformation on post-processing and generation of tables and figures in Pooled optical screening in bacteria using chromosomally expressed barcodes is found at DOI: 10.17044/scilifelab.26976952 (see Linked Information).\n",

      "description": "Phenotyping: \nAfter loading the pooled library into the microfluidic chip, the cells were grown in IPTG containing media for 8 hours to ensure that all cells in traps are direct descendants of the cell at the bottom of the trap. 100 positions were imaged for 6 hours every minute in phase contrast (80 ms exposure time) and every 5 minutes in epifluorescence (100 ms exposure time). One hour after the imaging started the experiment media was swapped to experimental media containing chloramphenicol (250 μg/ml).\nGenotyping:\nAfter phenotyping, cells were fixed and permeabilized with 70% EtOH for 20 minutes followed by 20 min rehydration in PBS with 0.1% Tween (PBS-T) at RT.\nFrom this stage all reaction mixes were administered to the front channel of the chip using a syringe pump and the lexan stage enclosure was kept at 30 degrees. The composition of the reaction mixes are given in Table S6 and are administered as described below: 1) To further improve cell permeabilization we flowed the lysozyme reaction mix at 1 μl/min for 10 mins onto the chip; 2) Lysozyme activity was stopped by flowing the BSA solution mix at 1ul/min for 10 mins; 3) To produce the RNA barcodes used for PLP binding we flowed the zombie transcription mixture to the chip at a rate of 0.5 μl/min for 120 min; 4) To allow the padlock probe hybridization to the corresponding RNA target we flowed the PLP hybridization mixture to the chip at 1μl/min for 30 min; 5) For the ligation of the padlocks hybridized to the\ntarget RNA, a SplintR ligase mixture was flown into the chip at 0.75 μl/min for 60 min; 6) To optimise the RCA reaction, the RCA primer hybridization mixture containing a primer complementary to the padlock probe was flown into the chip at 1 μl/min for 30 min; 7) For amplification of the padlock DNA we flowed the RCA reaction mixture onto the chip at 0.5 μl/min for 120 min. 8) Barcode detection: for each round of sequential FISH, the L-probes, which were pre-hybridised to detection oligos, were flown onto the chip at 1 μl/min for 30 min followed by imaging for genotyping; 9) Probes were removed from the RCA product by flowing the probe stripping mixture at 1 μl/min for 30 min. Steps 8 and 9 were repeated an additional 6 times with different known variations of L-probe detection oligo pools.\nThe L-probes were mixed for each hybridization-round according to the code allowing for error correction (See Table S7 for a list of the L-probes used). Each strain was assigned a randomly chosen 7-symbol code word (with an alphabet of 4 symbols), while ensuring that each code word has a Hamming distance of at least 3 symbols from all other 84 code words. Each symbol in the code is represented by a differently colored detection oligo. Thus, for each hybridization-round we mixed a collection of 85 L-probes each connecting the padlock probes readout barcode and the correct detection oligo for that round.\nAfter all genotyping rounds, DAPI stain at 1ug/ml (thermo scientific) was flown into the chip for 30 min which was then imaged using the DAPI optical setting.\n\n\n",
