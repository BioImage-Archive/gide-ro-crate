      "description": "While recent innovations in spatial biology have driven new insights into how tissue organization is altered in disease, interpreting these datasets in a generalized and scalable fashion remains a challenge. Computational workflows for discovering condition-specific differences in tissue organization typically rely on pairwise comparisons or unsupervised clustering. In many cases, these approaches are computationally expensive, lack statistical rigor, and are insensitive to low-prevalence cellular niches that are nevertheless highly discriminative and predictive of patient outcomes. Here, we present QUICHE - an automated, scalable, and statistically robust method that can be used to discover cellular niches differentially enriched in spatial regions, longitudinal samples, or patient groups. In contrast to existing methods, QUICHE combines local niche detection with interpretable statistical modeling using graph neighborhoods to detect differentially enriched cellular niches, even at low prevalence. Using in silico models and spatial proteomic imaging of human tissues, we demonstrate that QUICHE can accurately detect condition-specific cellular niches occurring at a frequency of 0.5% in fewer than 20% of patient samples, outperforming the next best method which required a patient prevalence of 60% for detection. To validate our approach and understand how tumor structure influences recurrence risk in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), we used QUICHE to comprehensively profile the tumor microenvironment in a  multi-center, spatial proteomics cohort consisting of primary surgical resections, analyzing over 2 million cells from 314 patients across 5 medical centers. We discovered cellular niches that were consistently enriched in key regions of the tumor microenvironment, including the tumor-immune border and extracellular matrix remodeling regions, as well as niches statistically-associated with patient outcomes, including recurrence status and recurrence-free survival. The majority of differential niches (74.2%) were specific to patients that did not relapse and formed a robust interconnected network enriched in monocytes, macrophages, APCs, and CD8T cells with tumor and stromal cells. In contrast, the interaction network for patients that relapsed was notably sparse and enriched in B cells, CD68 macrophages and neutrophils. We validated these findings using two independent cohorts, observing similar cellular interactions and predictive power. Collectively, these results suggest that salient, generalized profiles of productive anti-tumor immune responses are defined by a network of structural engagement between innate and adaptive immunity with tumor and stromal cells, rather than by any single specific cell population.

      "description": "MIBI run setup:\nQuantitative MIBI-TOF imaging was performed using a commercial MIBIScope instrument (IonPath, Menlo Park, USA). For each tissue microarray (TMA) core on each TMA, we used paired H&E images to identify the subregion that would be acquired on MIBI, avoiding areas of necrosis or empty slide. TMA cores were named by their row and column number in the TMA grid to enable easy mapping back to the appropriate metadata. To ensure that the cores were reliably assigned the correct row and column coordinates on the TMA, we added automated checks to identify naming errors and fix them following user confirmation. Prior to beginning data acquisition, the order of the cores was randomized to mitigate potential batch effects from instrument drift. \n  \nAcquisition settings:\nWe used the same settings across all MIBI data acquired in this study. The size of each field of view (FOV) was determined based on sample availability. When possible, FOVs of size (800 um)^2 and (2048 pixels^)2 were acquired. However, if insufficient tissue was present, an FOV size of (400 um)^2 and (1024 pixels)^2 was used instead. We used a custom preset of 8.0v beam current and 0.63ms dwell time to balance acquisition speed and image clarity. We disabled all default background correction and noise removal settings. \n\nMIBI-TOF cohort characteristics\nWe used MIBI-TOF imaging to generate high quality, multiplexed imaging data with subcellular resolution across 17 TMAs. The total dataset consists of 548 fields of view from 314 patients in the Spain TNBC study and 277 fields of view from 142 patients in the Stanford TNBC study. ",
