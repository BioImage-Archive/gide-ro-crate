      "description": "The role of Queen Mandibular Pheromone (QMP) in nurse honey bee lipid metabolism, particularly its effects on lipogenesis in the fat body and hypopharyngeal gland (HPG) size, remains uncertain. I hypothesize that (1) QMP exposure increases lipogenesis in the fat bodies of nurse aged bees, (2) because of this increased lipogenesis HPG size will increase, and (3) bees with higher fat body lipogenesis will have larger HPGs. Lipogenesis was measured through a fatty acid synthase (FAS) assay and the HPGs were viewed under a Leica microscope and measured through ImageJ. This experiment was a 2-factorial study, using age as one factor (either 3-day-old nurses or 8-day-old nurses) and QMP presence or absence as another. The nurse-aged bees were treated with QMP strips or not in cages supplied with sucrose and a protein paste diet with no lipids. The four treatment groups were replicated 3 times.",
