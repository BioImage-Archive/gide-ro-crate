      "description": "Bacteria typically form dense communities called biofilms, where cells are embedded in a self-produced extracellular matrix. Competitive interactions between strains within the biofilm context are studied due to their potential applications in biological, medical, and industrial systems. Combining mathematical modelling with experimental assays, we reveal that the spatial structure and the competitive dynamics within biofilms are significantly affected by the location and density of founder cells. Using an isogenic pair of Bacillus subtilis strains, we show that the observed spatial structure and relative strain biomass in a mature biofilm can be mapped directly to the locations of founder cells. Moreover, we define a predictor of competitive outcome that accurately forecasts relative abundance of strains based solely on the founder cells’ access to free space. Consequently, we reveal that variability of competitive outcome in biofilms inoculated at low founder density is a natural consequence of the random positioning of founding cells in the inoculum. Extending our study to non-isogenic strain pairs of B. subtilis, we show that even for strains with different antagonistic strengths, a race for space remains the dominant mode of competition in biofilms inoculated at low founder densities. Our results highlight the importance of spatial dynamics on competitive interactions within biofilms and hence to related applications.",
